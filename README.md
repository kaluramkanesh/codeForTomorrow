Build REST APIs with Typescript


Objective: Ability to check robust REST API with typescript emphasizing with clean and maintainable code.


Requirements


Develop the REST API with using Node (Typescript) and express js

Utilize TypeScript to write clean and strongly typed code.

Implement authentication and authorization using JWT tokens with the help HTTP only cookie.

Ensure input validation and error handling for data integrity and security.

Integrate the API with a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL using an

ORM (Prisma or TypeORM).

 Utilize caching for frequently accessed resources to improve performance.



Add support for real-time communication using WebSockets. The API should have

the following features:


Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

Bidirectional communication between clients and servers using the

Socket.IO library.

Broadcasting of messages to multiple clients using rooms or namespaces.

Integration with the existing REST API to enable real-time updates of resources.

Implemented session endpoints (User can only able to login on one system, if user tries to login on another system it will logout from first system).


Note: once you are done with your code. please create an open repo on GitHub push your code on the repo and replay the repo link on the same email and  Add everyone's cc who is currently in cc then you can disconnect and HR will update your result.
